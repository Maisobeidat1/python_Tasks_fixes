Ticket #482 (Conditionals syntax)

Issue: Wrong operator (= instead of ==) and inconsistent indentation.

Fix:
- Replaced = with == for correct comparison.
- Standardized indentation to 4 spaces (PEP8 compliant).
- Normalized input using .lower() before comparison.

Ensures correct logic, readability, and PEP8 compliance.

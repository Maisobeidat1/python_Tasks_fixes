 Ticket #481B (Variables & Strings)

Issue: Output printed without proper formatting (e.g., "HelloAlex").

Fix:
- Used f-strings with proper spacing for correct output.
- Applied snake_case naming for variables following PEP8 conventions.

Improves readability and ensures consistent, well-formatted output.

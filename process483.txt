 Ticket #483 (Imports hygiene)

Issue: Mixed imports on one line and incorrect grouping.

Fix:
- Separated imports into one per line.
- Grouped imports according to PEP8 standards:
   1. Standard library
   2. Third-party packages
   3. Local packages

Improves readability and maintainability of the code.
